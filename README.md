# 🛡️ Phishing Detection AI Agent 🔍  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Phishing Detection AI Agent** is an advanced cybersecurity tool that identifies phishing emails and suspicious URLs using **Machine Learning (ML) and Rule-Based Detection**. The system provides a risk assessment and visualization of phishing probability to help users mitigate online threats.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Phishing Detection** – Uses ML to predict phishing probability.  
- 🔗 **URL Analysis** – Detects fraudulent links in emails.  
- 📧 **Email Content Scanning** – Flags urgent/threatening language.  
- 📊 **Graph Visualization** – Compares ML predictions vs. rule-based scores.  
- ⛔ **Mitigation Advice** – Provides security recommendations.

## 📂 Usage  
- **Analyze Emails**  
  ```python
  email_content = "Urgent! Verify your PayPal account now: http://paypal-secure.tk/login"
  email_headers = {"From": "security@paypal.com", "Subject": "URGENT: Verify Your Account"}
  result = agent.analyze_email(email_content, email_headers)
  print(result)
  ```

- **Analyze URLs**  
  ```python
  url_result = agent.analyze_url("http://paypal-secure.tk/login")
  print(url_result)
  ```
